## Bayesian Inference:

A collection of notes, modified problem set solutions from a fourth year module, and additional exploration of Bayesian Inference.

Topics:

- Bayes Theorem (```bayes_theorem.ipynb```)
    - Bayes Theorem definition
    - Simple example of Bayes Theorem in action
        - Calculating a posterior based on a prior and data
        - Updating that posterior based on additional data
        
- Posterior PDF Calculation (```posterior_pdf_calculation.ipynb```)
    - Complex example of posterior PDF calculation

- Maximum Likelihood Estimators (```max_likelihood_estimator.ipynb```)
    - Estimator of the true mean of a dataset
    - Evolution of the estimator as new measurements are added
    
- Calculating and Using Odds Ratios
    - Odds Ratio definition
    - Calculating Odds Ratios for three models using subsets of a dataset (simulating taking data over time)
    - Estimating the most likely values of model parameters given a subset of data
    - Updating the most likely model and the model parameters as more data is added
