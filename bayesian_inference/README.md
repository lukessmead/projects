## Bayesian Inference:

A collection of notes, modified problem set solutions from a fourth year module, and additional exploration of Bayesian Inference.

Topics:

- Bayes Theorem (```bayes_theorem.ipynb```)
    - Bayes Theorem definition
    - Simple example of Bayes Theorem in action
        - Calculating a posterior based on a prior and data
        - Updating that posterior based on additional data
-Maximum Likelihood Estimators (```max_likelihood_estimator.ipynb```)
    - Estimator of the true mean of a dataset
    - Evolution of the estimator as new measurements are added
