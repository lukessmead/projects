Here are a collection of personal projects I am working on.

## Project Euler:

[Project Euler Webpage](https://https://projecteuler.net/)

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

### Currently solved problems: 0024 / 0827

## Bayesian Inference:

A collection of notes, modified problem set solutions from a fourth year module, and additional exploration of Bayesian Inference.

Topics:
- Bayes Theorem
- Posterior PDF Calculation
- Maximum Likelihood Estimators
- Calculating and Using Odds Ratios
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo
